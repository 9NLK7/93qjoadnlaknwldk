This was my first lua project so a lot (most) of this shit is skidded.

Originally made this to just compile all the scripts me and my friends used in NDS, but I thought other people might enjoy this aswell.

I'ts only obfuscated cuz of messy code + me wanting to see how obfuscation works in the first place.

You can find the source in past versions of the main file, I post the source but I can't find it.
