this was my first lua project so a lot (most) of this shit is skidded

originally made this to just compile all the scripts me and my friends used in NDS, but i thought other people might enjoy this aswell.

its only obfuscated cuz of messy code + me wanting to see how obfuscation works in the first place

you can find the source in past versions of the main file
